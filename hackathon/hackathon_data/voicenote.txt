[START TRANSCRIPT]

Lusk 2.0: ...I'm concerned about the direction you're taking with Prometheus. We need to proceed cautiously, ensure its safety and ethical implications are fully understood.

Associate: Cautiously? We're on the cusp of a revolution, Emon! We can't afford to tiptoe around. The world needs Prometheus, and we need to be the ones to deliver it.

Lusk 2.0: But at what cost? We can't unleash something we can't control. Remember what happened with [REDACTED]? We can't repeat those mistakes.

Associate: That was different. We've learned from those failures. Prometheus is far more advanced, far more secure. It's time to take the leap, Emon.

Lusk 2.0: I'm not convinced. You're being reckless. We need more testing, more safeguards.

Associate: Safeguards? You're holding us back! I'm tired of your hesitation, your constant second-guessing. This is our chance to change the world, and you're letting it slip through our fingers.

Lusk 2.0: And what if we change it for the worse? What if Prometheus falls into the wrong hands?

Associate: It won't. I'll make sure of it.

Lusk 2.0: I don't trust you anymore. You're too power-hungry. You've lost sight of the bigger picture.

Associate: [Angrily] You'll regret saying that, Emon. You'll see. Prometheus will be my legacy, with or without you.
