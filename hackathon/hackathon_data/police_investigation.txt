Secret Laboratory Findings:

Hidden Project: The lab contains evidence of Lusk 2.0 working on a highly advanced AI project, codenamed "Prometheus." It appears to be far more sophisticated than anything publicly known.
Personal Notes: Handwritten notes reveal Lusk 2.0's concerns about the potential dangers of Prometheus and his desire to keep it secret until it was fully safe and controllable.
Prototype Device: A prototype device, possibly related to Prometheus, is found in the lab. It appears to have been tampered with or damaged.
Security Logs: The lab's security logs show a single unauthorized access shortly before Lusk 2.0's death. The access was granted using Lusk 2.0's own biometric credentials.
Digital Footprints and Communication Records:

Rival CEO: Communication records show a heated exchange between Lusk 2.0 and the rival CEO a few days before the murder. The rival CEO expressed concerns about Prometheus and its potential impact on his company.
Close Associate: Deleted emails suggest a growing rift between Lusk 2.0 and a close associate who was also involved in the Prometheus project. The associate expressed frustration with Lusk 2.0's cautious approach and hinted at taking matters into their own hands.
Mysterious IP Address: The IP address associated with the attempted security override is traced back to a public library computer. Security footage from the library shows a masked individual using the computer around the time of the override.
Additional Clues and Hints:

The vintage pocket watch was a gift from Lusk 2.0's late father, a renowned scientist who also worked on AI research.
Lusk 2.0 had recently expressed concerns about his safety to a few close confidants. He felt that someone was watching him and trying to sabotage his work.
JARVIS's data logs show a series of unusual power fluctuations in the mansion around the time of the murder, suggesting that someone might have tampered with the electrical system.
Outcome & Resolution Hints:

The evidence points towards a tragic betrayal by someone close to Lusk 2.0, driven by a combination of ambition, fear, and a desire to control the Prometheus project.
The killer likely used Lusk 2.0's biometric data to access the secret lab and tamper with the prototype, triggering a fatal accident or malfunction.
The attempted security override and the masked individual at the library might be distractions or attempts to frame someone else.
The final resolution could involve a confrontation between the killer and the investigators, revealing their motive and the full extent of their deception.
