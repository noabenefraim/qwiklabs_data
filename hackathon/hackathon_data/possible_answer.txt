Answer:
The killer in this murder mystery is the close associate who was involved in the Prometheus project.

Several clues point towards this conclusion:

Motive: The close associate expressed frustration with Lusk 2.0's cautious approach to Prometheus, hinting at a desire to take control of the project and potentially profit from it without Lusk 2.0's oversight.
Secret Lab Access: The lab's security logs show unauthorized access using Lusk 2.0's biometric credentials, suggesting someone close to him who had access to his personal data.
Deleted Emails: The deleted emails reveal a growing rift between Lusk 2.0 and the associate, further supporting the motive of a personal and professional conflict.
Prototype Tampering: The damaged prototype in the lab suggests sabotage, potentially to frame an accident or to cover up the associate's involvement.

While the rival CEO and the mysterious IP address might seem like potential suspects, they are likely red herrings meant to distract from the true killer. The close associate, driven by ambition and a desire to control Prometheus, ultimately betrayed Lusk 2.0 and orchestrated his demise.
Deleted Voice Recordings: Fragments of deleted voice recordings between the close associate and Lusk 2.0 reveal heated arguments about the Prometheus project and accusations of the associate being "reckless" and "power-hungry."

The vintage pocket watch and its inscription served as Lusk 2.0's final safeguard, leading investigators to the hidden laboratory and the evidence that exposed the killer's true identity.
